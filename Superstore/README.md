Superstore Profitability Analysis with Tableau
This project aimed to improve the profitability of a struggling superstore by analyzing sales data and identifying key areas for improvement. Tableau was used to create data visualizations that informed strategic decision-making.

Data Source: Superstore.xls

Project Objectives:

Identify profitable and unprofitable product categories and regions.
Evaluate the effectiveness of advertising strategies.
Analyze product return rates and their impact on profits.
Key Findings:

Part 1: Profits & Losses
Visualizations were created to identify the most profitable and unprofitable product categories and regions.
Based on the analysis, recommendations were made regarding which products to discontinue and which subcategories to prioritize.
Part 2: Advertising
The project identified the top 3 state-month combinations for advertising based on average profit per unit sold.
A willingness-to-pay for advertising was calculated based on a return on ad spend ratio, considering a 1/5th allocation of profits for advertising costs.
Part 3: Returned Items
A calculated field was created to analyze return rates for products and customers.
Visualizations identified products and customer segments with the highest return rates.
An additional visualization explored the relationship between average profit and average return rate across various dimensions to inform business decisions.
