Shopify App Store Analysis with Power BI
This project involved analyzing a dataset of Shopify apps to understand key factors contributing to their success. Using Power BI, I explored various aspects of app performance, including review trends, developer responsiveness, and overall app popularity.

Key Findings:

App Landscape:

Analyzed the total number of apps available on the Shopify App Store.
Visualized the trend of review counts over time, providing insights into the evolving popularity of Shopify apps.
Investigated the relationship between the number of reviews and the average app rating, identifying potential correlations or outliers.
Review Analysis:

Created a new metric, "helpful_reviews," to weigh reviews based on their helpfulness.
Analyzed the impact of developer responses on average app ratings.
App Reviews by Developer:

Compared developers based on the sum of ratings received by their apps.
Analyzed developer performance based on the average "helpful_reviews" received.
Identified the most responsive developers for apps with a significant number of reviews (over 500).
Tools & Technologies:

Power BI: Data visualization and analysis platform.
DAX: Data Analysis Expressions for data manipulation and calculations within Power BI.
Deliverables:

A Power BI report with four pages: App Landscape, Reviews, App Reviews, and a summary page.
Eight screenshots capturing each of the visualizations created.
This project demonstrates my ability to:

Data Analysis: Analyze and interpret data to identify trends and patterns.
Data Visualization: Create effective and informative visualizations using Power BI.
Data Modeling: Establish relationships between tables within the Power BI data model.
DAX Programming: Utilize DAX expressions to create new calculated columns and measures.
Project Management: Organize and structure a data analysis project effectively.
